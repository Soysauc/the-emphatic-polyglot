# The Emphatic Diaglott

The Emphatic Diaglot is a spin on an old interlinear reference calle "The Emphatic Diaglot" by a man named Benjamin Wilson. It is a play on the title in reference to being a polyglot with spoken languages (and one sign). I had previously written these articles via Medium (https://medium.com/@TheEmphaticPolyglot/in-the-eye-of-the-hurricane-e3a43924ef50)
but I decided to host them here using React and Gatsby.

## The Great Gatsby

The blog posts were populated using a mixture of Markdown.md and also GraphQL. It was an interesting way of dynamically populating a web page without having to hard code HTML every time. I expect on poting more in the future and also adding images and styles so that it looks more attractive. I put some basic styles with Styled Components. It was the first time I used Gatsby.

### Future Changes

I expect to include other posts (I have a writing list) and then deply it potentially with Netflify (initially). Adding to it and further reading documentation surrounding Gatsby would also be in the future but also learning more about Gatsby in it of itself doesn't rank the highest on my priorities list, for I have other projects in their R&D phase.

#### Deploy

npm run deploy
