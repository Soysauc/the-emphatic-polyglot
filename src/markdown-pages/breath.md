A few years ago, when I was but a young lad I found myself in a dialogue with my uncle, a Registered Respiratory Therapist why he had chosen his career path. In particular, my young mind was puzzled with why he would choose the Lungs as the organ he would spend most of his studies and practice on. “Why the Lungs” I started. “Why not something important like the brain or the heart?”

He looked at me calmly, pondering over my question in earnest and through a soft intonation responded with “How long can you hold your breath without dying?”

This simple answer sufficed and informed me of how moronic my question really was and it satisfied my young curiosity for the evening. Yet, through the years, I continued thinking about the importance of what breath really is, not only in action, such as breathing, but also in its meaning.

All of those reading this article are (hopefully) breathing. As limited as that number may be, air is either flowing into our nose (or mouth) in the form of Oxygen, or flowing out in the form of Carbon DiOxide. This is known as Respiration. Basic stuff right?

When you fumble through your pantry and find a loaf of bread with mold on it, or you open a gallon of milk and it smells like a wet rag those products likely Expired.

When you watch a TedEx talk or a motivational speech on YouTube or hear a moving sermon you may likely start to feel Inspired.

All of these words are starting to sound a bit similar, no? Each of these words in english come from the latin spirare which is, to breathe. This happens to also be where another english word comes from: spirit.

In many Asian countries, such as Taiwan (not shown), lantern festivals were started as an attempt to get a glimpse of celestial spirits
Taking a closer look at the words mentioned above: respire, expire, and inspire respectively we start to see a pattern and perhaps have a new appreciation for these words.

Re- (Again)+ Spirare= ‘Again Breath’ or The act of breathing again, and again (…and again)

In (into)+ Spirare= gives the impression of breathe being poured into you. Spirit being poured into you. See the way the writer of the New Testament letter of 2 Timothy chapter 3 verse 16 phrases it: “All Scripture is inspired of God”. This ‘inspired’ could be phrased as ‘God breathed’ as it is done in many other translations of the New Testament.

The word Ex (out)- Spirare gives us the idea of ones spirit, or breath (again these terms are interchangeable to a relatively flexible degree) leaving, or coming out, of an individual.

Spirits in mythology and religions across the world tend to share similarities. For example, the Shinto Kami of Japan were not visible in the realm of man. The Hebrew Torah stated that no man could see Yahweh ( translated into LORD with all capitals in many bibles) and yet live (Ex 33:20). Taino of the Caribbean had the Cemi which were also invisible to those professing reverence. All of this to say that man cannot see spirits.

We can’t see breath either. But we know it's there. This isn’t an appeal to believe in spirits. This is an appeal though of being more mindful of words and their meanings. Their implications and their beauty.

My goal (or aspiration, yes this is from that same latin word)for the next few articles (however long I continue this series, dependent on if I have any prospective readers or engagement) is to shed some light, etymologically and linguistically, on words that we use every day. Words that we don’t think twice about but words nonetheless that are full of rich history and meaning. It is my goal to come out with articles regularly enough to keep a writing practice going and perhaps even put information out that may teach someone somewhere at some time a little something new about their language, and with that, perhaps a new perspective. This series of entries I am dubbing “The Emphatic Polyglott” and this is my first article written. If you made it this far and were entertained or educated please leave some sort of feedback and follow if you want more. Thank you for joining.
